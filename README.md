# Readable-Udacity
This project is a basic version of social media web app, created using react and redux.

Two packages necessary for this project are :-
1. api-server
* This is basically a web service which will return the response given a particular request.
All requests should have Authentication token in headers.
* SLA for this service can be found in server.js file which contains the format of request and response.
* Install dependencies by running npm install command within this directory.

2. frontend
* This package consist of all the code which is responsible to show the UI and change the state of UI based on user's interactions.
* It is using react framework for designing UI and Redux for state management.
* Install dependencies by running npm install command within this directory.

NOTE: Keep api-server and frontend packages within the same directory.

Once all the dependencies are resolved you can go ahead and run your api-server by npm run start.
Once that server is up and running you can go ahead and start your frontend server using npm run start.

It will open a window in browser at localhost:3000 (configurable), there you'll be able to use the readable project.
